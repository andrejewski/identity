# Identity
This is a collection of resources for my personal "brand" including my insignia and my default profile picture.

## Insignia

- [Color Insignia](insignia.png)
- [White Insignia](insignia-white.png)
- [Black Insignia](insignia-black.png)

## Backgrounds

- [Profile avatar](avatar.png)
- [Galaxy S7 background](galaxy-s7.png)
- [Macbook background](macbook.png)

## Building

Every image has an associated Sketch art board so making a huge change is not very efficient, but it's the best I can do.

This repository can be linked to so other projects can be up to date with the brand without needing to be changed. To build the `index.html`, run

```sh
brew install pandoc # if not already installed
pandoc README.md -f markdown -t html -s -o index.html
```
